## 🚀 Our Mission

At TekBreed, we believe that the future of coding education is **interactive**, **personalized**, and **collaborative**. We are building a comprehensive platform that moves beyond passive video watching to active, hands-on building.

Our goal is to empower developers to go from "Hello World" to "Senior Engineer" through a unified ecosystem that combines world-class content, real-time mentorship, and AI-powered assistance.
